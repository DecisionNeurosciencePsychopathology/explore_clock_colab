However, because the artifact appeared in various parts of the preprocessed html file (e.g., the brain mask) it seemed to be pretty severe. After taking a look at spatial normalization, the gap between the brain hemispheres was pretty substantial! This is one I would reference in the future if you have any questions about whether there's too much CSF or if the gap between brain regions is too wide--this one is severe enough to not pass in my opinion."
